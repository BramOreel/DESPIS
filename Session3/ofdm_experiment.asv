%% OFDM experiment
% Generate a pseudo random binary sequence of a user defined length.

% Modulate bit sequence.
[QAM_seq,x] = qam_mod(bit_seq,M);

% Modulate QAM sequence using OFDM.

% Add white Gaussian noise.

% Demodulate OFDM sequence.
rec_QAM_seq = ofdm_demod(rec_OFDM_seq,N,Lcp,4);

% Demodulate QAM sequence.

% Calculate BER.

%OFDM: first you modulate your signal using QAM, signal is in frequency
%domain. The conversion to ofdm basically means that you put one QAM on one
%OFDM carrier wave. these carriers are at distinct frequencies within the
%bandwith
% 
% 
% 
% Using STFT we can convert a small part of these QAM symbols by 
%doing a ifft where DC = 0 and fn = 0. Imagine the STFT graph.
%The ifft results in a time domain graph of overlapping ofdms?
% 
% the signals overlap but at the right sampling times there is no overlap
% 
% DC = zero because this is a constant power consumption, the bias of the
% signal is also stored here√π
%
%N/2 = 0: we want to avoid spectral leakage
%
%Symmetry because we want ifft to be real
