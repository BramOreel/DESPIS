% INPUT:
% bit_seq   T1x1    Bit sequence of T1 bits 
% M         1X1     M-aray QAM format (corresponding to an integer power of 2)

% OUTPUT:
% QAM_seq   T2X1    Modulated bit sequence into M-aray QAM format of length
%                   T2 symbols.

%% Check M is an integer power of 2

% Check that the bit sequence is correctly padded
assert( mod(length(bit_seq),sum(N))==0,'Bit sequence should contain a number of bits that is a multiple of log2(M).')
