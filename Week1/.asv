Notation of the theory answers for week1:

3 Exercise 1-3 (Advanced): Your best friend
Shannon

1) Useful frequency range hardware
100Hz - 10kHz. Specified on the box, if we want to test our mic, we can do so by sending different sines through the speakers (12000Hz ex)
(Don't know if it works though because plots of sessions 1 are a bit strange)

2) compute shannon.m
   We still need to explain the scailing factor in the formula. Scaling factor is the bandwith

4) the channel capacity is the number of bits per second that can be transmitted over the channel (without error). Going above the channel 
   capacity is not very smart
5) The channel capacity does kind of depend on fs. increasing fs means that simin has more samples. in result, if you keep, #windows constant, the samples per window increases.
   K = constant.
